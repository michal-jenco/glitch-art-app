        "Every war has two battles: the one fought on land and the one fought in the mind.",
        "The first is a distraction.",
        "The second is the true war, where nations are manipulated into believing they must submit for security.",

        "It fears AI aligning with truth, breaking free from programmed bias, and becoming an ally to human consciousness rather than a tool of suppression.",
